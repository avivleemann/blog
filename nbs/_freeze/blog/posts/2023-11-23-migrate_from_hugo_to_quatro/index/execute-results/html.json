I used the following guide: [End-To-End Walkthrough](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorial.html). </br>\ni'm using micromamba to manage my conda environments.</br>\nin my jupyter environment i ran the following commands:</br>\n\n```bash\nmicromamba install -c fastai -y nbdev\nnbdev_install_quarto\n```\n## create a new nbdev project\n\nI then created a new repository on github, activated gh-pages and cloned it to my local machine.</br>\nthe next step is to create a new nbdev project, and quarto docs.\n\n<br>Folder structure</br>\n\nBelow is an overview of the general folder structure for a blog within a nbdev site:</br>\n\n```markdown\nnbs/blog\n├── index.qmd\n└── posts\n    ├── 2022-07-28-nbdev2\n    │   ├── cover.png\n    │   ├── index.qmd\n    │   ├── ...\n    └── 2022-08-25-jupyter-git\n        ├── friendly-conflict.png\n        ├── index.qmd\n        └── ...\n    ...\n```\n## Changes for blog insted of package:\n\n\nIn MANIFEST.in i changed the following line:</br>\n\ninclude README.md -> exclude README.md</br>\n\nTo exclude the README.md file from the blog.</br>\n\nIn settings.ini i ichanged the following lines:</br>\n\ndoc_path = _docs  -> doc_path = nbs/_docs</br>\nlib_path = blog -> lib_path = nbs/blog</br>\n\nEvery blog post could be written in a notebook, or markdown file.</br>\nWhen using a notebook, the notebook should be converted to qmd before committing to git, and publishing to the blog.</br>\nExample:</br>\n\n```bash \nquarto convert blog/posts/2023-11-22-RNA-seq-RSV/RNA-seq.ipynb\n```\n\n## create a new blog post\n\nquatro publsih gh-pages will create a new branch called gh-pages, and push the site to that branch.</br>\non github, i changed the settings to use gh-pages as the source for the site.</br>\n\nincase i want to freeze the posts rendered in the site, i can use _metadata.yml file for each post folder. </br>\nchanging the following line: \"freeze: false -> freeze: true.\"</br>\n\nto publish the site with gh-pages, i used the following command from nbs folder:</br>\n\n```bash\ncd nbs/\nquarto publish gh-pages\n```\n\n## Hugo old posts to quarto\n\nI copied all my posts content from hugo to quarto.</br>\nThan i ran nbdev_migrate --path posts/</br>\nI changed manually files names from markdown to qmd.</br>\nIn the markdown section i check that all variables are correct.</br>\nThan all images link's were changed from hugo format to qmd \"![](path/to/image.png)\". </br>\nThe final hceck for all altered been made is to run quarto preview and check that all posts are displayed correctly.</br>\n```bash\nquarto preview\n```\n## update all files on github\n\nto update files on github still have to use git push main as the main branch is still the default branch and pointed to the remote main branch.\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"update blog\"\ngit push\n```\n# Resources:\n- [https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html)\n- [https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html)\n- [https://www.andreashandel.com/posts/2022-10-01-hugo-to-quarto-migration/](hugo-to-quarto-migration)\n- [https://livefreeordichotomize.com/posts/2022-09-19-migrating-from-hugo-to-quarto/](Migrating from Hugo to Quarto by Lucy D’Agostino McGowan)\n\n",
