This blog was created using Hugo.</br>
I decided to migrate to quarto as it is easier to use, and I can use Jupyter notebooks to create blog posts.</br>
As I found it easier to use notebooks to create blog posts, I decided to migrate to quarto.</br>
In the process, I used nbdev and quarto to update my old blog posts and create new content.</br>
nbdev and quarto can also be used to create and maintain a package.</br>
Example:
I created a small package called [volcanoPlot](https://avivleemann.github.io/volcanoPlot/).

## install nbdev and quarto

The first step is to install nbdev. I used the following guide: [End-To-End Walkthrough](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorial.html). </br>
i'm using micromamba to manage my conda environments.</br>
in my jupyter environment i ran the following commands:</br>

```bash
micromamba install -c fastai -y nbdev
nbdev_install_quarto
```
## create a new nbdev project

I then created a new repository on github, activated gh-pages and cloned it to my local machine.</br>
the next step is to create a new nbdev project, and quarto docs.

<br>Folder structure</br>

Below is an overview of the general folder structure for a blog within a nbdev site:</br>

```markdown
nbs/blog
├── index.qmd
└── posts
    ├── 2022-07-28-nbdev2
    │   ├── cover.png
    │   ├── index.qmd
    │   ├── ...
    └── 2022-08-25-jupyter-git
        ├── friendly-conflict.png
        ├── index.qmd
        └── ...
    ...
```
## Changes for blog insted of package:


In MANIFEST.in i changed the following line:</br>

include README.md -> exclude README.md</br>

To exclude the README.md file from the blog.</br>

In settings.ini i ichanged the following lines:</br>

doc_path = _docs  -> doc_path = nbs/_docs</br>
lib_path = blog -> lib_path = nbs/blog</br>

Every blog post could be written in a notebook, or markdown file.</br>
When using a notebook, the notebook should be converted to qmd before committing to git, and publishing to the blog.</br>
Example:</br>

```bash 
quarto convert blog/posts/2023-11-22-RNA-seq-RSV/RNA-seq.ipynb
```

## create a new blog post

quatro publsih gh-pages will create a new branch called gh-pages, and push the site to that branch.</br>
on github, i changed the settings to use gh-pages as the source for the site.</br>

incase i want to freeze the posts rendered in the site, i can use _metadata.yml file for each post folder. </br>
changing the following line: "freeze: false -> freeze: true."</br>

to publish the site with gh-pages, i used the following command from nbs folder:</br>

```bash
cd nbs/
quarto publish gh-pages
```

## Hugo old posts to quarto

I copied all my posts content from hugo to quarto.</br>
Than i ran nbdev_migrate --path posts/</br>
I changed manually files names from markdown to qmd.</br>
In the markdown section i check that all variables are correct.</br>
Than all images link's were changed from hugo format to qmd "![](path/to/image.png)". </br>
The final hceck for all altered been made is to run quarto preview and check that all posts are displayed correctly.</br>
```bash
quarto preview
```
## update all files on github

to update files on github still have to use git push main as the main branch is still the default branch and pointed to the remote main branch.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "update blog"
git push
```
